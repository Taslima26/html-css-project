      <p>85 gm plain flour</p>
      <p>40 gm cocoa powder</p>

    <section class="Instructions">
      <p>
        Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl.
        Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the
        bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water.
        Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring
        occasionally to mix them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with
        cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the
        melted mixture to cool to room temperature.
      </p>

      <p>
        While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle
        of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/ 160C fan/ gas 4
      </p>

      <p>
        Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking
        parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder
        into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they
        run through together and you get rid of any lumps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.
      </p>

      <p>
        Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster
        sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and
        sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take
        3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s
        ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original
        volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and
        wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters
        leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or
        two, you’re there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold
        together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take
        it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the
        middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the
        bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until
        the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The
        idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and
        slow as you like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the
        cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover
        the top evenly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as
        before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit
        unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will
        end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as
        you don’t want to overdo this mixing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re
        dotted throughout.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the
        bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the
        tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes,
        open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the
        brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in
        and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust
        and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of
        the oven.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re
        using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the
        uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out
        the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into
        four squares and finally into triangles.
      </p>

      <p>
        They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the
        freezer for up to a month.
